## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a BE graduate (2026) and an aspiring **Java Full Stack Developer**, currently undergoing a **Java Full Stack internship**, where I am gaining hands-on experience in building **end-to-end web applications**.

My core expertise lies in **Java**, with strong knowledge of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **exception handling**, **collections**, **multithreading**, and **file handling**. I actively work with **Spring Boot** to develop **RESTful APIs** and backend services, following **clean coding practices** and **layered architecture**.

Alongside Java-based development, I also have good knowledge of the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** and have built full stack applications using modern frontend and backend technologies. I am comfortable working with both **Java Full Stack** and **MERN-based architectures**.

On the frontend side, I have experience with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React** to build responsive and user-friendly interfaces. I also work with **Oracle SQL** for database design and CRUD operations and use **Git & GitHub** for version control.

Through my internship and personal projects, I have gained practical exposure to **full stack development**, **API integration**, and **real-world problem-solving**. I enjoy learning new technologies, collaborating with teams, and taking ownership of assigned tasks.
