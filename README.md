## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a BE graduate (2026) and a **Java Full Stack Developer intern**, gaining hands-on experience in building **end-to-end web applications**.

My core expertise is in **Java**, with strong knowledge of **OOP, exception handling, collections, multithreading, and file handling**. I work with **Spring Boot** to build **RESTful APIs** using clean coding practices and layered architecture.

I also have experience with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** and modern frontend technologies. I build responsive UIs using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React**, and work with **Oracle SQL** for database operations.  
I use **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
